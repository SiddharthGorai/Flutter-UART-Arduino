# UART Communication Android App with Arduino

This project demonstrates real-time **UART serial communication** between an Android application and an Arduino device via USB. The Android app sends a specific command (`"A"`) to the Arduino, which then processes the command and sends back a confirmation response (`"received"`). The app shows a success notification and navigates to a home screen upon confirmation.
